## App information
Some information with regards to the application:
- Everything was done to be as dynamic as possible and not hard coded. However, in the *ProviderInformationTableViewController.swift* file, when parsing any extra information with regards to the provider's properties in the JSON file, this was semi-hard coded due to time and complexity.
- There is information on the usage of the app in the *FAQ* section within the application
